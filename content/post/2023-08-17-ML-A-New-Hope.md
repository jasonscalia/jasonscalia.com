As a technologist, I got into this field because I love all things computing, so it's strange but somewhat rewarding to decide to specialize. The first step being taking my AWS ML cert in the next 2 months or so.

Without going in to too much personal detail, Math and I have always had a hate-hate relationship: I hated Math and Math hated me. This is not a particularly uncommon story, but how unfortunate for the young technologist. If only I knew then what I know now.

## Some History

Fast forward a few years after my first College attempt, I find myself facing realizing my greatest asset is my stubborness. I also find myself in an industry increasingly relying on developer knowledge that I've somewhat remained at the edges of for my whole career until the last year or so.

So what does a stubborn 30-something do that insecure 20-something would never have fathomed? Convince myself that I _can_ do the Math, go back to school for a math heavy degree (Computer Science), and dive head-first in to all my fears.

## Why?

The question remains then, why? My answer? I've found the more I keep myself in somewhat challenging and uncomfortable positions, the more I grow as a person but also intellectually. What better way to remove the enormous chip on my shoulder than dive in to a Math heavy degree, weaponizing my stubborness, righting the wrongs of the past.

## What's your point?

Math and I, we're friends now. We've put the past behind us and in our advancing age, realize we have a lot more in common than we did in those halycon days of my youth.

I'm also going to waste the opportunity to insert a great metaphor here. I'm nearly done with my CS degree, eagarly looking forward to getting a Master's degree, and diving head first in to the Machine Learning and AI space.

## Conclusion

The insecure, Math-phobic wannabe music journalist of my 20's would never have believed this, nearly assured that I would be living alone, in a remote area of PA, installing new Linux distros.

How wrong we can be when we try to predict the future or, perhaps, let our pasts dictate our future.
