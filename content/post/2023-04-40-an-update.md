So I'm kind of, but not quite, holding true to my promise to update the site more. Anyways, I'm wrapping up my CS degree which is pretty exciting. I've been looking in to UT Austin's [AI Program](https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai) for a Master's degree, but we'll see what happens with that.

### AI/ML

I started going through Code Academy's [Machine Learning](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/machine-learning) course, which is pretty interesting. This is an area of great interest to many right now and personally I love de-mystifying any percieved "magic", so I'm looking forward to completing this (and continuing to beef up my Python chops!)

### AWS

On the AWS certification front, I'm looking to go for my Machine Learning Speciality as well as Data Analytics. One of the best perks of working for an AWS Premier Partner is access and encouragement in getting these certs, so might as well learn something new!

### Kubernetes

I've also been spending a lot of time with kubernetes lately and hope to post a bit about that. I've dabbled with k8s over the years, but I've made a concerted effort to dive in lately.

What really helped me was ["The Kubernetes Book"](https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Book-Version-November-2018-ebook/dp/B072TS9ZQZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1N552MBKV096N&keywords=the+k8s+book&qid=1682904081&sprefix=the+k8s+bo%2Caps%2C191&sr=8-1) (no affiliate links). It gets updated for free annually, so that's a hard value prop to beat.
