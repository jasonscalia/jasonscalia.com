## About Me

Howdy, I'm Jason! I'm a former New Jerseyan now living in Austin, Texas with my wife and 3 dogs. I started this site to begin sharing information again after a many year pause from my previous Wordpress-based site.

It's been a joy comparatively building this out in Markdown with Hugo.

### Career

I currently work for [Effectual](https://www.effectual.com/), an AWS Premier Partner. Prior to that, I've most recently worked at [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com) and [Datapipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapipe) (purchased by Rackspace).

I started out as a linux administrator, before becoming an Engineering Manager at Rackspace and then a Cloud Architet at Effectual. I've been using AWS since about ~2010.

I'm also working on completing my B.S. in Computer Science with Western Governor's University, so I've been keeping busy!

### Interests

Retro computing (DOS-era), traveling, racing/cars, collecting the occasional rare piece of literature, and wargaming (computer and trying out tabletop).
